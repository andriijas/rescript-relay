You're encouraged to read the [official Relay documentation on client schema extensions](https://relay.dev/docs/guides/client-schema-extensions/). Client schema extensions work the same in RescriptRelay as in Relay itself.

For updating client-only data, you're encouraged to refer to the [page in modifying the store locally](interacting-with-the-store.md).
