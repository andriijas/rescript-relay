We've got a video series covering Relay, some GraphQL, ReScript and RescriptRelayRouter. It's growing and will eventually cover everything you need to get up and running using these techniques.

This series is intended to function as _onboarding material_ for developers starting with Relay and ReScript.

Even if you're not using RescriptRelay (yet, right!) there's a good amount of Relay knowledge and tips and tricks in there, so check it out.

This page lists all videos and what they cover.

## Introduction and project outline

- Setting up a new RescriptRelay project
- Setting up your editor
- Basic route configuration with RescriptRelayRouter
- The Relay network layer

...and more.
